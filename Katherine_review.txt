Your layout is very nice especially the side navigation bar! The feature to edit the comment that has already submitted is functional and useful. My suggestion is creating an add recipe page that allows users to add their own recipes and maybe also allow users to upload pictures of their dishes. By the way, I find that your navigation bar will change if I click into your about page and there¡¯s no way I can come back to the main page of those recipes unless I go to the review page first. In all, it¡¯s a wonderful app and I like it.
